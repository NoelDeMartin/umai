        This text is here just to make this div grow... If you're reading this without using some
        developer tool, this is a bug. Please report it :).

        It actually needs to be quite long, so just for kicks allow me to
        add one of my favourite quotes from Sherlock Holmes:

        "I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic,
        and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all
        the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might
        be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other
        things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skillful workman
        is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but
        the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment,
        and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has
        elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for
        every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest
        importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones."
