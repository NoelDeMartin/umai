      Solid is a decentralized storage protocol built on top of web standards. If you want to use this app across devices, you can use Solid to keep changes in sync. Even if you use it in a single device, this will also keep your recipes secure in case your device is lost. It is also useful to share recipes with others.

      In any case, Umai works 100% offline and you can connect your Solid POD later on. If you've never heard of Solid and you're just trying things out, you don't need to know anything about it.

      This will create a container and register it into your [private type index](https://github.com/solid/webid-profile/blob/main/notes/typeIndex.md).

      If you don't want to do this, you can create a container yourself (or use an existing one) and register it into the type index as a container for `https://schema.org/Recipe`
      resources.

      If you're feeling adventurous, you're also welcome to look at the [source code](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/umai/blob/main/src/services/CookbookService.ts#L46) to see how
      this app does it.
