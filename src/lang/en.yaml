proxyConfig:
  title: Do you want to use a proxy?
  info: |
    This application runs entirely in the browser, so you will need a proxy in order to read content from other websites (or you will run into [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) issues).

    You can still import recipes without a proxy, but you'll have to copy & paste the source HTML into a text box.

      Solid is a decentralized storage protocol built on top of web standards. If you want to use this app across devices, you can use Solid to keep changes in sync. Even if you use it in a single device, this will also keep your recipes secure in case your device is lost. It is also useful to share recipes with others.

      In any case, Umai works 100% offline and you can connect your Solid POD later on. If you've never heard of Solid and you're just trying things out, you don't need to know anything about it.
