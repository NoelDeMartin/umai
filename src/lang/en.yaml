  proxy: Use a proxy when importing from the web
  proxy_description: |
    Whenever you try to import recipes from other websites, you will need a proxy or you will run into
    [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) issues. This application comes with a default
    proxy, or you can also [configure your own](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/umai/blob/main/docs/using-a-proxy.md).

webImport:
  title: Import recipes from the Web
  info: |
    If there is a recipe online that you want to save in your cookbook, just paste the url below. We will look into that page
    and find all the relevant information like instructions and ingredients.

    If don't know where to start, just open your favorite search engine and type away! Even if the website you find doesn't
    look like a recipe, give it a try. You may be surprised to see what you get.

  useProxy_helpTitle: Using a proxy
  useProxy_helpContent: |
    This application runs entirely in the browser, so you will need a proxy in order to read content
    from other websites or you will run into [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
    issues.

    If you want, you can still try importing recipes without a proxy, but if it fails you'll have to copy & paste
    the source HTML into a text box.

    The proxy at `{proxyUrl}` is refusing to scan the website because it's

    whatIsSolid_content: |
      Solid is a decentralized storage protocol built on top of web standards. If you want to use this app across devices, you can use Solid to keep changes in sync. Even if you use it in a single device, this will also keep your recipes secure in case your device is lost. It is also useful to share recipes with others online.

      In any case, Umai works 100% offline and you can connect your Solid POD later on. If you've never heard of Solid and you're just trying things out, you don't need to know anything about it.
