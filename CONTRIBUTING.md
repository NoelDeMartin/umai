# Contributing

I am open to contributions, but if you're thinking on some big feature or refactor, you should open an issue to discuss it first. That will increase the chances of it getting merged, and it will prevent you from wasting your time if it's something I'm not willing to integrate. You can also open a draft PR if you want to support your idea with some code, even if it's not finished yet.

If you're just proposing a small change or fix, you probably don't need to discuss anything, just open a PR :).

If you want to contribute translations, read the [translations contribution guide](./docs/contribute-translations.md).
