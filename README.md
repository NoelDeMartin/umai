Umai is a simple Recipes Manager to collect all your precious recipes.

- 📗 Create your own cookbook.
- ✨ Import recipes from any website.
- 🧙 Adjust ingredient quantities automatically.
- 👨‍🍳 Share recipes with your friends.
- 📱 Use it completely offline (it's an offline first PWA!).
- 🔐 Keep data safe in your [Solid POD](https://solidproject.org/).

## Under the hood

If you're curious to learn how this came to be, I've been keeping a development journal: [
Implementing a Recipes Manager using Solid](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/implementing-a-recipes-manager-using-solid).

There is currently no documentation for developers, but you can get started by learning its main technologies:

- [Vue](https://vuejs.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Soukai Solid](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid)
